# MachineLearning
Here is the Project Stratus repository for developing and maintaining [name TBC], our RL agent for controlling an inflatable balloon with the aim of station-keeping it around a target location.
---
### Goals
- Develop a balloon object (Currently operational in 2D)
- Develop an RL model which can control said balloon object by increasing or decreasing altitude (Currently operational in 1D)
- Develop a realistic amtospheric environment to train the model in (Not implemented yet)

### Getting started
